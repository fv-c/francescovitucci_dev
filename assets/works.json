      "description": "In Human Memories is a piece for pre-recorded and AI-generated voices, four cellos and live electronics. It explores the archetype of abandonment, inspired by the tragic stories of three different Didoes, taken from the operas by Niccolò Piccinni, Domenico Sarro, Henry Purcell. Each of them represents a unique aspect of love, loss and desolation, while retracing, dozens of times in the history of music, a well-known pattern: falling in love, Aeneas' abandonment, Dido's death. As in Greek tragedy, the audience is called to question the authenticity of emotions and memories in an era in which artificial intelligence can replicate and generate human-like expressions. As the piece unfolds, subtle features in the AI-generated lyrics and cloned voices can reveal the artificial nature of the fake memories employed, ultimately suggesting an underlying theme: the intrusion of AI into the deeply human experience of emotion.",

The piece presents a formal arc segmented into sections, in which the performer explores very different listening areas, with their own peculiarities and identities. This piece breakdown is reflected in the processes of Live Electronics. Starting from a miking of the listening space and subsequent extraction of audio descriptors, various control signals are determined. Thus, a process of information \"feedback\" is created, emphasized, hidden, suppressed, kept alive by the interpreter's gestures. The interpreter interacts with the electroacoustic instrument at the auditory level only, stimulating the computer system using adaptive control signals. Using the footswitch can force a sudden opening of time windows in which live electronics processes can emerge. It's recommended using it discreetly, three or four times during the first section, characterizing each intervention. A single obligatory pedal intervention is foreseen, as marked in the score.",

      "description": "Dedicated to ICO Metropolitana di Bari.<br>The flame, the fire: common elements of local popular traditions, as demonstrated by the \"Register of festive rituals related to fire\" of the Puglia Region, but also of conceptually and geographically distant traditions. Symbol of heat and light, fire plays a particular role in the rite, becoming its climax: think of the rites of Christian Easter, as well as of the Orthodox one, a connection of traditions that the city of Bari has long learned to value. This compositional work, Prelude to the rites of fire, therefore seeks its own ritual dimension, in which the sound becomes an anabatic vehicle of tension towards the top not in strictly musical terms, but in imaginative ones. There is no rite without the reiteration of a gesture and one could say that there is no understanding of the musical meaning without the reiteration of a musical gesture. The piece therefore presents iterations of the same gesture which, in its most complex or most basic form, sculpts time, accompanying and preluding, perhaps, to something to come.",

      "description": "The concept of variation is one of the cornerstones on which traditional tonal music has been based, from its very beginnings to its most complex evolutions. A very effective classification of variation typologies was provided by Vincent D’Indy in his <em>Cours de Composition musicale</em> (Durand, 1948). The composer-treatise writer, in this work, distinguishes three typologies of variation: <em>ornamental</em>, obtainable through the application of melodic ornaments; <em>decorative</em>, the result of various modifications, including harmonic ones; finally <em>amplifying</em>, taking up the idea of ​​thematic amplification, typical of traditional classical music.<br>The <em>Variations</em> for Orchestra were modeled according to these principles. An exposition presents the chorale “Jesu, meine freude” in its entirety, in one of Johann Sebastian Bach’s harmonizations (BWV 227, in E minor), entrusted to the different sections of the ensemble, first the strings, then the woodwinds and brass. Five variations follow, each of a different character, in a progressive departure from the original theme. Although these variations are self-contained, they are not conceived as juxtaposed entities, but rather contextualized in a continuous flow of gradual transformation.<br>The piece ends with a double fugue. The exposition is followed by a series of modulations, modeled according to an imitative writing typical of the fugal entertainment: through a sudden caesura we move on to a new exposition of a second subject, at the end of which the meeting and overlapping of both subjects occurs. By increasingly tightening the various entrances we reach the climax of the piece that represents the return to the starting point, in a sort of circle that, finally, closes.",

      "description": "First prize at International Composing Competition \"2 agosto\" XXVII Edition.<br>Dedicating a Composition competition to a terrible event, such as the Bologna massacre, is an undertaking that reveals how it is possible to stimulate the birth of new fresh branches from a ruined, destroyed stump. The \"2 agosto\" Competition is exactly this: a virtuous and precious procedure that, with force, unfolds creativity. Regarding the Bologna massacre, what has always struck me is the solution of continuity. eighty-five lives were literally interrupted, forever suspending the rituality of life, a ritual that some of them had even just undertaken. Around this idea takes shape \"Nelle pieghe\" (lit. \"In the folds\"), a piece for orchestra designed and created expressly for the \"2 Agosto\" Competition and dedicated to each of those eighty-five people. \"To interrupt\" can mean \"to tear\" a texture, disturbing very precise vector processes, directions that are thus found to no longer exist. But this is not the only way to interrupt something. A texture, however, can also be folded, hiding one or more parts, thus bringing together two different states of the same vector process, but precluding the process itself from view. So the idea is precisely this: what looks like a \"tear\" is in reality only a \"fold\", which hides materials, processes and directions. The work in question is divided into a series of sections, four specifically, which explore in a non-linear way some states of the musical material used. The first section presents the superficial fibers, extremely alive, iridescent and fibrillating. A \"class\" of affirmative syntagms is presented, articulated in a main macro-syntagm and in a series of aliases which, from time to time, broaden the frequency range, gradually distributing themselves over the entire orchestral mass. Soon the thesis, represented by the jeté of the strings, and the desinence, both smooth and striated, entrusted to the resonances of woodwind, brass and percussions, are expanded with the addition of a preparatory arsis. The syntagm thus becomes a sort of \"pulsar\" which tends to destabilize and depolarize the ecosystem in which it is found. The latter actually belongs to a second class of syntagms, generally entrusted to the strings, sensitive to the pulsations of the main object, whose presence alters its frequency field. The two classes thus tend to establish a lively, fluid dialectic. Through a metric modulation, suddenly the first tear occurs, or, better, the first unfolding, which shows a decidedly foreign, very deep level, with very different logics. In an almost fractal way, the two levels also establish a dialectical relationship, this time unbalanced: each unfolding becomes more and more prominent, so much so that at the end of the first section it is no longer possible to \"fold\" the texture to return to the higher level. The second section explores the space (or rather time) within this fold. The fibers of musical texture are very rarefied and relegated to very distant spectral areas. A magmatic texture, entrusted to double basses and contrabassoon, expands for the entire temporal extension, folded into a very slow ascending vector. A series of thinner fibers emerge, entrusted to the four solo strings, managed by a \"heterophony by constrained quantization\" algorithm, specifically designed for this work, which allows these four ethereal entities to weave a sort of very acute \"chant\" with irregular contours and out of focus, reverberating in a space virtually recreated by the resonances of all the other string instruments. The third section represents the opposite side of the main fold, in a sort of ascent towards the initial texture. The crotales are entrusted with the role of starter of this process that attempts to join the two levels so far apart. The initial macro-syntagm is much more dilated and extended, in a sort of stretching process that lets a series of sharp and sparkling artifacts emerge (the crotales themselves). The ascent ends with the beginning of the fourth section which shows an evidence: processes that alter the material are not compatible with an unaltered return of the material itself. The main syntagm has almost disappeared. It has now lost the connotation of an affirmative and thetic event, only its contours (still entrusted to the strings) can be seen together with a series of rarefied morphemes which, almost rhizomatically, flash episodically in an epilogue that shows only the shells of this articulated process.",

This is the idea behind Projections for string trio and live electronics (2023).

This phenomenon is distorted when two stones are dropped into the water: the two wave fronts interfere with each other, sometimes amplifying their reciprocal effects, other times completely cancelling them out, in an algebraic sum of pressure. The construction of Corpora (2022) for eleven instruments is based on this concept of \"interference\", constructive and destructive. The \"bodies\", to which the title of the piece refers, are two, macroscopically arranged on antithetical levels, characterized by very different behaviors and with a parallel life course. Despite this, the two \"bodies\" possess their own force of proximity, which generates interference. In the reiteration of their individual behaviors, the two levels tend to exchange energy: sound events of the first \"body\" pass into the other; instrumental gestures of the first are modulated by elements of spectral indeterminacy, typical of the second; and so on. The two different sound \"bodies\" discover themselves, in some way, compatible.",

      "description": "Dedicated to Trio Lumen.<br>250 years after the birth of Ludwig van Beethoven, his music appears, today more than ever, imbued with a desire to go beyond traditional sound construction, to reach directly into the heart of sound itself. This is absolutely noticeable in the production of the last period of the German composer's life, a critical period for his awareness of his growing deafness: losing his hearing, Beethoven acquires the ability to construct sound, to invent remarkable perceptive devices, to also simulate physical behaviors of sound itself. The construction of sound is certainly a compositional aspect that fascinates, stimulating the search for new possibilities, from an instrumental and technical point of view. This piece, expressly requested by the Trio Lumen and dedicated to them, exploits a series of elements linked to the sound perception of those who, on the other hand, have lost the ability to do so. The analogies with Beethoven's musical treatment are curious: the use of the extreme regions of the sound spectrum; the use of the sustain pedal combined with the figuration of trill and tremolo to arrange indistinct \"clouds\" of sound; the frequency distribution that fulfills a \"rule\" of euphony-dissonance, or relaxation-tension. All this is welded together in the search for an idea, that thematic idea, at the beginning of the Trio op.1 n.3, which is here slowly reconstructed in an absolutely non-linear process of mental construction (just as, in modern times it has been specified, normally occurs in the human brain).",

This theme, which cuts across all religions (monotheistic and polytheistic), is approached here from a point of view mythological, therefore creation as the first event which sanctions the birth of a world.<br>In a way, Sampo himself gave the idea. The term \"Sampo\" is of Finnish origin and designates a magical object that gives power and wealth. In the virtual place of the composition, where the listening will take shape, it's Sampo which gives life to a primordial act. If it is correctly calibrated, following a solicitation of the saxophone, the Sampo reacts by giving us a huge vibration primitive, at the origin of everything that will make up the piece. In order to get this first event, the Sampo has been calibrated to recreate a kind of algorithm Karplus Strong (very short delay / very high feedback), the basis of the modeling of plucked string instruments.<br>This piece therefore cannot do without an \"Activator\" (Saxophone) and an \"Expander\" (Sampo). The possibility offered by Sampo, that of being governed by the same musical performer, achieves an almost impossible fluidity effect by other means. The piece therefore traces the phases of a sudden awakening, of the birth of a connection, of the awareness of an interdependence. In this game of symbiosis, an attempt to detach one of the two entities takes shape, which will acquire more and more independence, trying to go beyond established boundaries.<br>Attempts that will cause another awakening, much more human.",

This mechanism also exists in nature in its inverse configuration, so that a child can possess cells of its mother within itself.<br>This exchange, which is added to the hereditary one of the genetic patrimony, has provided a starting point for conceiving this composition in which two entities are closely linked in an interdependent way. The acoustic instrument, the saxophone, has its own well-defined historical and technical identity. The electroacoustic instrument initially appears much more shapeless, by comparison, presenting a role and a timbre very dependent on the acoustic instrument, in a behaviour of \"mimic\" of the gestural or intentional actions of the saxophone: in this way, the electroacoustic instrument \"learns\" to perform a vibrato (with the help of a multigestual sensor).<br>The two instruments influence each other, in an initially suspended, resonant scenario, which is the background to a continuous process of gestural osmosis and, in some way, of individual growth.

The title of the first of them, Tanka[tanka[tanka[...]]], refers to the application of a single class of modules, but with different magnifications. In this way a certain gradient of fractality develops, which can be found from the articulation of small units up to the entire shape. (ch)Oral is a kind of multiphonic choral, organized in real phrases, with a gloss entrusted to electronics, a second entity which, in the second part of the fragment, will expand the beats already present in the instrumental technique. The third segment is titled A dialogue with \"anyone\" and develops a monologue of the saxophone, with the electronics apparently absent or at least distant, in a completely different level (with some resemblance). The fourth segment uses the \"centone\" technique, cutting instrumental gestures and syntactic morphemes from the three previous segments and recombining them by proceeding backward (backward chaining). Back to the first instrumental gesture, the electronics make its entrance, proposing a swarm organized on audio materials coming, once again, from the previous parts.",

Il termine, originariamente, indicava in realtà il supporto stesso che serviva a realizzare queste immagini votive, ovvero la tavola di terracotta che, mediante incisione, sarebbe poi diventata “portatrice di senso”, ospitando ora una scena di sacrificio, ora una battuta di caccia, e così via.<br>Quest'oggetto, così limitato per forma e dimensione, ospita quindi dentro di sé ben più di quello che si vede sulla superfice, per due motivi: una rappresentazione simbolica offre spazio a possibili interpretazioni, differenti anche ad ogni lettura; inoltre, una qualsiasi “scena” implica un “retroscena”, in cui agiscono forze che non sono direttamente “visibili”, ma si muovono, vivono, esistono, per così dire.<br>Queste idee hanno portato alla scrittura di Pinax (2021) per violino solo.<br>Tutto inizia con una dichiarazione, uno “statement” iniziale del materiale, la superfice del tessuto che compone il brano. Seguono una serie di letture che focalizzano l’attenzione su alcuni particolari, mostrando vari percorsi che si intrecciano libermente e che si svolgono, via via, in uno strato sempre più differito rispetto alla “scena” iniziale.",

Questa operazione, svolta in più step, è consistita nello scegliere di volta in volta un suono consonantico differente, o anche più di uno, basato sulla convenzione IPA Kiel, e filtrare tutte le parole contenenti ciascun suono, unendole in delle nuove strutture testuali, ovvero degli alias del testo principale.",

      "description": "In che misura il suono appartiene all’essere umano?<br>L’intera composizione prende spunto dall’idea che la musica sia la vera e propria dimensione sonora di ciascun essere umano. Ciascun individuo possiede una predisposizione sensoriale alla “cattura e decodifica” di eventi sonori, nonché alla “sintesi” e riproduzione di ulteriori eventi.<br>I primi due brani del trittico, Larinx e Corti, traggono spunto da questi concetti, sviluppando una serie di campi sonori, all’interno dei quali trovano spazi alcuni spettri armonici, derivanti quindi dalla natura fisica di un corpo vibrante.<br>Il terzo brano, Flegma, invece si rifà alla Teoria umorale costruita da Ippocrate di Coo. Il flegma è uno dei quattro umori che caratterizza l’equilibrio dell’essere umano: esso corrisponderebbe, sempre secondo questa antica teoria, all’acqua, vero e proprio elemento costitutivo della vita. Appare quindi una curiosa analogia tra questo elemento e una delle possibili etimologie del termine “musica”, che fa derivare questo termine da “moys”, un antico vocabolo egiziano che indica, in effetti, l’acqua.",
