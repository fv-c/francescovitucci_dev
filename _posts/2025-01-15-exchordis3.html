    I am glad to share that my essay, <strong>In Human Memories. Tecnica, creatività e autodeterminazione: una proposta etica</strong>, is part of the issue. This research rwork, developed by a team composed of Giuseppe Silvi, Francesco Abbrescia, Anthony Di Furia, Francesco Scagliola and myself, investigates the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern compositional practices, with a particular focus on my compositional work <em>In Human Memories</em> (2024).
