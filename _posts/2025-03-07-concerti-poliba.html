    My talk at the conference ‘Music. From Pythagoras to A.I.', held in Bari on 04-03-2025 at the Politecnico di Bari's ‘Museum of Photography’, ended with great enthusiasm! It was an incredible opportunity to share ideas, explore techniques and engage with a passionate community. My talk received great feedback, and discussing IHM and AI-assisted experimentation in such a stimulating context was a real pleasure.
