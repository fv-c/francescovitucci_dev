    The proceedings for the International Csound Conference 2024 (ICSC 2024) have been officially published. This collection includes a diverse range of papers, presentations, and research contributions from leading composers, technologists, and sound artists engaged in the development and creative use of Csound.

    I am glad to share that my publication, <strong>Opening Mind by Opening Architecture: Analysis Strategies</strong>, is part of the proceedings. This paper, developed together with a team composed of Giuseppe Silvi, Daniele Giuseppe Annese, Francesco Scagliola, Anthony Di Furia and myself, explores the construction of analytical tools that aim to create awareness in the DSP design. The full text of the paper can be downloaded from the following link:

    The proceedings offer valuable insights into cutting-edge techniques, new tools, and experimental approaches, reflecting the ongoing evolution of the Csound community and the innovative projects shaping the future of computer music.
